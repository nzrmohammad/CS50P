:no_entry_sign: Cheating Violates:
The [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2023/honesty/) of the course, not to mention it's totally pointless if you actually want to learn programming.

:email: Concerns:
I like to share my progress, which also helps motivate me to finish the course faster. However, if any directors of the course want me to take this down, I will gladly do so. Just shoot me a message via <mohammad.nazari@live.com>.
